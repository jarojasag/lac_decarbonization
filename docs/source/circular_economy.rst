The **Circular Economy** sector represents liquid and solid waste from municipal and domestic sources.


Liquid Waste

Liquid waste is divided into the following categories, denotes as ``$CAT-WASTE-LIQUID$``.

Wastewater Treatment
====================

Wastewater can be treated using a variety of pathways. Note that aerobic and septic pathways produce sludge, which can disposed of in a variety of ways; the SISEPUEDE model does not currently integrate sludge removal and disposal from aerobic and septic treatment pathways.

.. note:: IPCC accounting (IPCC GNGHGI V5, C6 2019R) calls for emissions from secondary sludge extracted from aerobic WWTPs to be divided between decentralized treatment (uncollected) and centralized treatment, where centralized aerobic treatment includes sludge treatment on-site, accounting for emissions of sludge due to treatment--e.g., from anaerobic decomposition--in the Wastewater Treatment sector. Instead, SISEPUEDE accounts for all emissions from sludge treatment in the Solid Waste sector.

Solid Waste
===========

Solid waste is generated by consumption. Growth in domestic consumption in is driven by GDP per capita, while growth in industrial consumption is driven by production (represented by value added). Solid waste can reach one of four final states: incineration (or open-burning), landfilled, recycling (or composting/anaerobic biogas production for food and yard waste).

.. note:: Process emissions for recycling of recyclable materials that affect virgin production--glass, metals, paper, plastic, rubber and leather, textiles, wood--are treated in `Industrial Processes and Product Use <./ippu.htm>`_.

Variables by Category

.. csv-table:: The following variables are required for each category ``$CAT-WASTE-SOLID$`` of solid waste.

   :header-rows: 1

Categories
----------

Solid waste is divided into the following categories, denoted as ``$CAT-WASTE-SOLID$``. The solid waste attribute table requires the specification of parameters used to characterize different types of waste. These parameters--with the exception of industrial and chemical waste--are derived from default values provided by the IPCC in Volume 5, Chapter 2, Table 2.4 of the `2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories <https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/index.html>`_ and the `2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories <https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html>`_ (which contains the table) for the source of parameters. Industrial parameters come from Volume 5, Chapter 2, Table 2.5.
