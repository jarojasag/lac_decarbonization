Input,Forest Fire Emission Factor,Annual average :math:`\text{CO}_2` emitted per ha due to forest fires (≥ 0),"``ef_forestfires_$CAT-FOREST$_$UNIT-MASS$_$EMISSION-GAS$_$UNIT-AREA$`` (``$EMISSION-GAS$ = co2``, ``$UNIT-AREA$ = ha``, ``$UNIT-MASS$ = gg``)",Forest fires are represented in the land use transition matrix as part of ``$CAT-FOREST$`` to the class ``other``. Reductions in this transition can represent reductions in forest fires. ,0
Input,Forest Methane Emissions,Methane emissions from forests,"``ef_forestmethane_$CAT-FOREST$_$UNIT-MASS$_$EMISSION-GAS$_$UNIT-AREA$`` (``$EMISSION-GAS$ = ch4``, ``$UNIT-AREA$ = ha``, ``$UNIT-MASS$ = gg``)",See `Yale <https://e360.yale.edu/features/scientists-probe-the-surprising-role-of-trees-in-methane-emissions>`_ or `Nature <https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00122-z>`_ for more information on methane emissions from forests.,0
Input,Forest Sequestration Emission Factor,Annual average :math:`\text{CO}_2` emitted per ha from sequestration (< 0 – this is a negative number),"``ef_sequestration_$CAT-FOREST$_$UNIT-MASS$_$EMISSION-GAS$_$UNIT-AREA$`` (``$EMISSION-GAS$ = co2``, ``$UNIT-AREA$ = ha``, ``$UNIT-MASS$ = gg``)",,0
Output,:math:`\text{CO}_2` Emissions from Forest Sequestration,Sequestration in forests modeled as negative emissions,``emission_co2e_$EMISSION-GAS$_frst_sequestration_$CAT-FOREST$`` (``$EMISSION-GAS$ = co2``),,1
Output,:math:`\text{CH}_4` Emissions from Forests,Total methane emissions from forests,``emission_co2e_$EMISSION-GAS$_frst_methane_$CAT-FOREST$`` (``$EMISSION-GAS$ = ch4``),,1
