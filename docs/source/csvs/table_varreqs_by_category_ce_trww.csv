 | **NOTE:** default factors of 0.35 are used for most water treatment plants (<0.35 is specified in Table 7). Advanced plants are treated as the conceptual mean of ""Anaerobic pond + facult. pond + maturation pond"", ""UASB + dissolved-air flotation"", and ""UASB + maturation ponds"", which have values of >0.5, 75-88, and >0.5. Using nominal values of 0.5, 0.5, and 81.5, this gives a mean 0.605.",,,0,1.0,1.0,0
