Input,NemoMod CapacityFactor,"Fraction of time a technology is availble to operate. Can vary by region/technology--note that model variable input trajectories vary by scenario dimension and region, so the variable schema does not include a region designation. Required dimensions include time slice. This value is in the interval [0, 1] and is specified annually.",``capfac_elec_tech_$CAT-TECHNOLOGY$_$CAT-TIME-SLICE$``,,,,,0,1,1
Input,NemoMod CapacityToActivityUnit,"Factor that relate a region's power unit to its energy unit (varies by technology). The factor has the units :math:`\frac{U_{energy}}{U_{power}YEAR}`, where :math:`U_{energy}` is the energy unit and :math:`U_{power}` is the energy unit.",``nemomod_entc_capacity_to_activity_unit_$CAT-TECHNOLOGY$_$UNIT-ENERGY$_to_$UNIT-POWER$``,,See `NemoMod Units of Measure<https://sei-international.github.io/NemoMod.jl/stable/units/#uoms>`_ for more information,,,0,1,1
