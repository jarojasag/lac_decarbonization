Input,NemoMod VariableCost," | According to `NemoMod <https://sei-international.github.io/NemoMod.jl/stable/parameters/#VariableCost>`_ , VariableCost is ""Running cost for a technology, defined in terms of cost per unit of nominal energy produced. Nominal energy is calculated by multiplying dispatched capacity by the length of time it is dispatched.""
