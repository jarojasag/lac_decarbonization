Input,Biogas Recovery Factor at LSMM Anaerobic Digesters,,``gasrf_lsmm_biogas_$CAT-MANURE-MANAGEMENT$``,,``anaerobic_digester``,,,,0,1,1,0
Input,Fraction of Nitrogen Used in Fertilizer," | This scalar represents the fraction of total volatile solids (manure) available for fertilizer. Some categories, like ``deep_bedding`` are often combined with others. To avoid mutli-stage management, entries for these categories should specify a fraction of manure that will eventually end up used in fertilizer.

 | **NOTE:** Incineration is included since urine is separated and sent to fertilizer. The fraction that is sent to fertilizer is applied only to nitrogen in urine.",``frac_lsmm_manure_to_fertilizer_$CAT-MANURE-MANAGEMENT$``,,``anaerobic_lagoon``|``daily_spread``|``deep_bedding``|``dry_lot``|``incineration``|``liquid_slurry``|``poultry_manure``|``storage_solid``,,,,0,1,1,0
Input,Nitrogen from Bedding per Animal," | Represents :math:`N_{beddingMS_{(T, S)}}` in Equation 10.34 in V4, C10 IPCC GNGHGI 2019R, or the amount of nitrogen from bedding.
