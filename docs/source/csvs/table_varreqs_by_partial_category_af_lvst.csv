Input,Carrying Capacity Scalar,This scalar represents changes to the number of livestock/hectare. Advanced grazing techniques or pasture restoration could scale this.,``scalar_lvst_carrying_capacity``,,none,,,,0,0.8,1.2,0
Input,Elasticity of Livestock Demand to GDP per Capita,Elasticity of meat/animal products demand to income; use GDP/Capita since there's a roughly linear relationship between income and gdp/capita,``elasticity_lvst_$CAT-LIVESTOCK$_demand_to_gdppc``,,``cattle_dairy``|``cattle_nondairy``|``sheep``|``chickens``|``pigs``,Some validation of assumption that income and gdp/capita are linearly related: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/median-daily-per-capita-expenditure-vs-gdp-per-capita,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378021001229#b0020,0,0.8,1.2,0
Input,Fraction Nitrogen Excretion in Dung,Fraction of nitrogen :math:`F_{N-DUNG}` excreted by livestock that's contained in dung. 1 - :math:`F_{N-DUNG}` is contained in urine.,``frac_lvst_n_in_dung``,,none,,,,0,1.0,1.0,0
Output,Total Domestic Animal Mass,"Sum, across all livestock animals, of product of head of livestock and weight per head less changes to net imports. This value is used in the integrated model to project changes to protein consumption in the circular economy model.
