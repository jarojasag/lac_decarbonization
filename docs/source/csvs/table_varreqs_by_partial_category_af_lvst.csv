Input,Carrying Capacity Scalar,This scalar represents changes to the number of livestock/hectare. Advanced grazing techniques or pasture restoration could scale this.,``carrying_capacity_scalar``,none,,,,,0
Input,Elasticity of Livestock Demand to GDP per Capita,Elasticity of meat/animal products demand to income; use GDP/Capita since there's a roughly linear relationship between income and gdp/capita,``elasticity_$CAT-LIVESTOCK$_demand_to_gdppc``,``cattle_dairy``|``cattle_nondairy``|``sheep``|``chickens``|``pigs``,,Some validation of assumption that income and gdp/capita are linearly related: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/median-daily-per-capita-expenditure-vs-gdp-per-capita,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378021001229#b0020,0
Input,Fraction of Meat Consumption from Imports,Fraction of all meat consumed in the country that is imported ,``frac_rmd_imported``,none,,Should be between 0 and 1,,,0
Input,Fraction Eating Red Meat,"Gives a scalar *a* for demand for red meat in the country. Used to represent adoption of vegetarianism. Decreases in this scalar lead to increases in crop consumption, with the per-capita demand for crops increasng by the scalar **dietary_exchange** for 100(1  - *a*)% of the population.",``frac_eating_red_meat``,none,,,,,0
Input,Health Benefit per Capita from Reduced Meat Consumption,Health benefit per person for switching to a vegetarian diet.  ,``benefit_per_capita_no_red_meat``,none,,,,,0
