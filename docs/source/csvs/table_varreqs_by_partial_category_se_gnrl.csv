Input,:math:`\text{CH}_4` Annual Emission Limit," | Used in NemoMod to calculate AnnualEmissionLimit. Can be used to model an exogenous policy limit on total emissions, but cannot be used to mandate negative emissions in the Electricity sector.

Input,Fraction Eating Red Meat,"Gives a scalar *a* for demand for red meat in the country. Used to represent adoption of vegetarianism. Decreases in this scalar lead to increases in crop consumption, with the per-capita demand for crops increasng by the scalar **dietary_exchange** for 100(1  - *a*)% of the population (see land use sector). Additionally, population-level changes to diet impact the protein content of wastewater.",``frac_gnrl_eating_red_meat``,,none,,,,0,1,1,0
