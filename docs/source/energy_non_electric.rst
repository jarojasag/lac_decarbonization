Non-Electric Energy
===================

Energy includes a range of variables and categories. Given the integrated nature of the energy sector, there are several "cross-subsector" categories required to construct the NemoMod energy model. These categories include Fuels and Technologies, which . The dimensions required for the NemoMod framework are available from the `NemoMod Categories Documentation <https://sei-international.github.io/NemoMod.jl/stable/dimensions/>`_.


Modeling Concepts and Important Notes
=====================================

Fuels and Heat Energy
---------------------

In general, energy is produced by stationary or mobile combustion of different fuels. The combustion of fuels releases :math:`\text{CO}_2`, :math:`\text{CH}_4`, and :math:`\text{N}_2\text{O}` (and other gasses, which may not be captured). These fuels are utilized by different technologies, which may use fuels at different efficiencies. Energy can also be stored (specifically electricity). The term **fuel** is explicitly used in all energy subsectors, while **technology** and **storage** are used in the NemoMod electricity model.

.. note:: Fuels are used in both non-electric energy and electric energy. However, since they are a required component of the NemoMod electricity model, variables and attributes associated with fuel are available in the `Energy - Electricity <./energy_electric.html>`_ section.

The combination of fuel and efficiency is an important concept for entering input data. Energy use in SCOE and CCSQ both use a fraction of energy *demand at point of use* to project future changes in fuel mixtures. However, many empirical data that are used rely on energy *consumption*, and both SCOE and CCSQ take initial consumption as inputs to SISEPUEDE.

Let

* :math:`D_t` be the total energy demand at time :math:`t`
* :math:`C_t` be the total energy consumption at time :math:`t` in question (**input to model**)
* :math:`\alpha^{(C)}_t \in \mathbb{R}^n` be the vector of fuel mix fractions of *consumption* at time :math:`t` for :math:`n` fuels
* :math:`\alpha^{(D)}_t \in \mathbb{R}^n` be the vector of fuel mix fractions of *demand* at time :math:`t` for :math:`n` fuels (**input to model**)
* :math:`e_t \in \mathbb{R}^n` be the vector of fuel-technology average efficiencies at time :math:`t` for :math:`n` fuels, the demand is

:math:`D_t = C_t\left(\alpha^{(C)}_t \cdot e_t\right)`.

The fraction at point-of-use demand :math:`\alpha^{(D)}_{ti}` for fuel :math:`i` is then calculated as

:math:`\alpha^{(D)}_{ti} = \frac{\alpha^{(C)}_{ti}e_{ti}}{\alpha^{(C)}_t \cdot e_t}`,

i.e., the point-of-use demand is the efficiency-weighted fraction of consumption. For more information on the energy models' mathematical specification, see the `Mathematical Documentation of Energy Models <./mathdoc_energy.html>`_.

Stationary Combustion and Other Energy (SCOE)
=============================================

SCOE (**S**\tationary **C**\tombustion and **O**\tther **E**\tnergy) captures stationary emissions in buildings (split out by differing drivers) and other emissions not captured elsewhere. SCOE requires the following variables.

.. note:: | Energy efficiency factor represents the technological efficiency for the system of heat energy delivery. Some system/fuels may conserve energy more efficiently than others.
          |
          | For example, a value of 0.8 would indicate that 20% (1 - 0.8) of the input energy to the system (e.g., for heating, cooking, water heaters, etc.) is lost (e.g., 1.25 TJ of input energy satisfies 1 TJ of end-use demand), while a value of 1 would indicate perfect efficiency (1 TJ in :math:`\implies` 1 TJ out)
          |
          | At time :math:`t = 0`, the efficiencies are used to calculate an end-user demand for energy, which elasticities are applied to to estimate a point-of-use demand. In subsequent time steps, as the mix of energy use changes, input energy demands are calculated using the efficiency factors of different mixes of fuels.

Transportation consists of different categories (or modes) of transportation that are used to satisfy different types of demand. In general

Known Issues
------------

**Discuss how variables that are set in Transportation have to be added to the NonElectricEnergy class as well**


Variables by Category
---------------------

.. note::
   :math:`\text{CH}_4` and :math:`\text{N}_4\text{O}` emissions from mobile combustion of fuels are highly dependent on the technologies (e.g., types of cars) that use the fuels. Therefore, emission factors for mobile combustion of fuels are contained in the Transportation subsector instead of the Energy Fuels subsector. See Section Volume 2, Chapter 3, Section 3.2.1.2 of the `2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories <https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/2_Volume2/V2_3_Ch3_Mobile_Combustion.pdf>`_ for more information.

Transportation Demand
=====================

Transportation demand is broken into its own subsector given some of the complexities that drive transportation demand (unlike other subsectors, like SCOE, that do not contain categorical mode-shifting within demands). The **MODELNAME** transportation demand subsector allows for more complex interactions--e.g., interactions with industrial production, growth in tourism, waste collection, and imports and exports--to be integrated, though these are not dealt with explicitly at this time.

For each transportation demand category ``$CAT-TRANSPORTATION-DEMAND$``, the following variables are required.
