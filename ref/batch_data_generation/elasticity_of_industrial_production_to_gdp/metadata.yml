      descrip:   Generated using GDP and Production (historical) numbers from SISEPUEDE Dataset


aditional_information:
      assumptions: >
            - Get historical elasticities to GDP and use as direct inputs to SISEPUEDE (used to replicate historical emissions)
            - Use data from historical period to estimate elasticity of production to GDP and project industrial growth
            - elasticities are bound using `elast_bounds` variable (set between -0.5 and 2.0)
            - apply this elasticity at the _second_ projection time period following the historical, and drift to 1 by final time period (elast = 1 is proportional growth with GDP)
            - for first projection time period, use a regression over historical time periods to estimate point (also bounded at +/- some proportion `max_dev_from_mean`, set to 20%)
