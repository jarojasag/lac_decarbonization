      descrip: >
            - ESSD synthetic data (see additional information--https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/13/5213/2021/) are synthetic emission data used to 

aditional_information:
      assumptions: >
            - Combine ESSD synthetic emissions data with production numbers (historical values of SISEPUEDE model variable "Initial Industrial Production" as stored in sisepuede_data repository) to estimate emissions.
            - In cases where multiple emission outputs coincide with one ESSD estimate, distribute homogenously
            - The **ESSD dataset** gives some sector-level emissions that we cannot obtain elsewhere, notably chemicals and cement emissions

            - The data include mappings to IPCC emission codes, and it could be used as part of a two part calibration or aggregate calibration (IPPU + INEN at the same time)
